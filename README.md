All of these are homework assignments. Homework 3 and 6 are my own, but homework 5 was a group project- I have permission from my groupmates to upload this project.


Homework 5 has the README in its directory. In summary, I worked with 2 other group members and gained experience with JavaScript to make a math game. I am not responsible for the code regarding the math, but I helped to add functionality to the buttons in Javascript and CSS, functionality to the "workspace" area, and the overall styling in CSS. 

Homework 3 was to help us get familiar with basic HTML and CSS.

Homework 6 helped me get familiar with using APIs and appending to the webpage with the API.
